# Who works on what

# Coding style 

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#prescriptive-naming-conventions

## we have subdirectories for the code, one for each chapter
## if java relies on having different implementations depending on the type:
Use somehting like
```
class DirectedDFS:
	def __init__(self, G, *s):
```
like in `graphs/directed_dfs.py`

Otherwise we use static factory methods where the name indicates the expected type.
If appropriate we use `isinstance()` and its variants, for example to distinguish undirected and directed graphs. 
## things like 'node' are inside classes, no leading underscore
## file names, variables, methods are file_name (and not CamelCase, adjustting from algs4), only classes are CamelCase (PascalCase)
## there is one file per version of an algorithm / data structure (like in algs4), the name, and importantly the docstring, reflects which version it is
## java main becomes __main__ stuff; follow what is there; adjust the initial comment
## don't replicate imports unless 

## variable names: 
- lower case letter with underscore
- like in the book
- private variables become _variable_name

## if java has toString(), then we have __repr__()

## keep the comments from the java code 
## if in doubt, we go with the book, not the code on the book web site (keep it simple)
## docstring without formatting
# ideas
- should we include generators (additionally to iterators) everywhere?
